# skyscrapers
# Skyscrapers is a logic game in the placement of houses. In this game you need to place
# buildings of different heights on the game board so that the number of visible buildings
# from a certain position (the number with the arrow is a hint) was equal to the number in
# the hint. The arrow in the tooltip indicates the direction in which you want to look.
